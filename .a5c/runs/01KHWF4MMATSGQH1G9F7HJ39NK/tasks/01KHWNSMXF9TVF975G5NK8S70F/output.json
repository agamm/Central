Middle pane: Chat area with 'Select a project' empty state and prompt input. Right pane: 'No project selected' placeholder. Agent nesting and status badges cannot be verified without Tauri backend (Vite-only), but UI compiles and renders without errors. The new AgentList, SessionItem, StatusBadge components are structurally integrated.",
