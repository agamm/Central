  "feedback": "All 9 core tasks complete. Mock sidecar, Rust manager, event bridge, SQLite persistence, Zustand store, full chat UI with thinking/tool call blocks and message queue. Key gaps: uses emit() instead of Channels API, handleSubmit exceeds 50-line limit, no tests, no session restore on startup.",
  "recommendations": [
    "Decompose ChatPane.handleSubmit (108 lines) into smaller functions",
    "Replace emit() with Tauri v2 Channels API for typed streaming",
    "Add session restore on mount from SQLite",
    "Write agent lifecycle tests (start, complete, abort, queue drain)",
    "Fix sidecar path resolution for production",
    "Remove dynamic import in useAgentEvents.ts"
