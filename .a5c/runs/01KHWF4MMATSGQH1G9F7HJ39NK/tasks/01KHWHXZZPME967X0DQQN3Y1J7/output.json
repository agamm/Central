  "feedback": "All 7 phase tasks complete. Strong code quality: functional paradigm, no any, Zustand selectors, neverthrow Results, all files under 300 lines. Build clean on all 4 checks. Minor gaps: no project feature tests, stale name bug in AddProjectDialog, store errors not surfaced to UI.",
  "recommendations": [
    "Add src/features/projects/store.test.ts for project store logic",
    "Fix stale name in AddProjectDialog with useEffect on defaultName",
    "Surface store errors to user via toast/banner",
