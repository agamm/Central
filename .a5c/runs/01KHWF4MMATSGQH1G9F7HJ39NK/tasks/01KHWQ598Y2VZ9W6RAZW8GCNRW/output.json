  "feedback": "All 6 phase tasks implemented: git2-rs Tauri commands (file tree, git status, file content, diff) split into 6 Rust sub-modules all under 130 lines, CodeMirror 6 viewer with custom dark theme and Compartment-based language switching, file tree with git status indicators (yellow/green/red), diff viewer with line coloring, git status bar with branch/ahead/behind, all wired into the right pane. All files under 300 lines, all functions under 50 lines, no any types, Zustand selectors used throughout. Build passes all 3 checks after fixing 16 ESLint errors. UI correctness score is reduced because file tree and CodeMirror cannot be fully verified without Tauri backend.",
  "recommendations": [
    "Add error boundary around CodeMirror to gracefully handle rendering failures",
    "Consider adding a loading skeleton for the file tree while data loads"
