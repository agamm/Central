  "feedback": "All 5 phase tasks implemented. xterm.js with fit/web-links/webgl addons, portable-pty Rust backend, PTY streaming, debounced ResizeObserver, right pane split. All files under 300 lines (longest: terminal.rs at 226). Build passes all 3 checks. Note: uses Tauri emit/listen instead of Channels API as specified in PLAN.md, but matches existing codebase pattern from Phase 3. UI shows correct split with empty states. Minor deduction: Channels API deviation.",

    "Consider migrating to Tauri Channels API in Phase 7 or 8 for typed streaming",
