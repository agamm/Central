  "description": "App renders stably with all three panes. Phase 8 only added test files — no UI changes. The app still shows the three-pane layout: projects sidebar (empty state), chat pane (empty state with prompt input), and right pane (file viewer + terminal empty states). All elements render correctly, confirming test additions did not break the UI.",
