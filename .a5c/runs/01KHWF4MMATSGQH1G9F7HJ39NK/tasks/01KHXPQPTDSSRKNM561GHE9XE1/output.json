  "description": "App now shows a refined native-macOS-feeling dark theme. Background is very dark (near black). Panel separators are barely visible hairlines. Text hierarchy is muted — 'PROJECTS' header is small and dim, empty state text is appropriately subdued. Icons are low-opacity. The overall feel is much closer to Cursor/Conductor than default shadcn. No blue tint, no boxy card containers, no harsh borders. The input area at bottom is embedded with a subtle border. Three-pane layout with panels differentiated by slight shade differences rather than heavy borders.",
